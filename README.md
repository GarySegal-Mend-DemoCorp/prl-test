## Description

This service is a wrapper for the Parallels Desktop DevOps Service. It allows you
to start, stop, pause, resume, and reset a virtual machine. It also allows you to
get the status of a virtual machine.

## Licensing

You can use the service for free with up to 10 users, without needing any
Parallels Desktop Business license. However, if you want to continue using the
service beyond 10 users, you will need to purchase a Parallels Desktop Business
license. The good news is that no extra license is required for this service
once you have purchased the Parallels Desktop Business license.
