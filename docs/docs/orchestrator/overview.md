# Parallels Desktop Orchestrator Service

The Parallels Desktop Orchestrator Service is a service that can run in a
container or directly in a host and will allow you to orchestrate and manage
multiple Parallels Desktop Api Services. This will allow in a simple way to have
a single pane of glass to manage multiple Parallels Desktop Api Services and
check their status.
You will also be able to create virtual machines automatically and let the
orchestrator choose the host with enough free resources
